I am a PhD student at the [School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com) and [Prof. Aviral Kumar](https://aviralkumar2907.github.io). During my master's program at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University](https://cims.nyu.edu), I was introduced to the joys of machine learning and robotics research by [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com). 


Before that, I was an associate at Goldman Sachs. Even before that, I was an undergrad in computer science at the [National Institute of Technology, Calicut](https://nitc.ac.in/).
