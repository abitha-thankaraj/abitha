I am a Masters student in Computer Science at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). Currently, a research assistant at [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision and Robotics group), working on robot learning and reinforcement learning advised by [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/). 

Previously, I was an Associate at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at [National Institute of Technology, Calicut](http://www.nitc.ac.in/).

In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, jiu jitsu, folding [origami](https://abitha-thankaraj.github.io/) and [reading](https://abitha-thankaraj.github.io/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
